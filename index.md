## Welcome to Copart Internship 2017 summer coding camp

Copart Coding camp is an initiative to get students to think out side the box and bring in new design/development ideas. Copart believes that such events are good tools to attract new talent and also stimulate creative thinking. We encourage participation.
 

### RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
Each participant has to pick a problem statement below and show his/her work.
Do not copy. Try to be creative.
Understand what you are developing.
Code must be committed to Github or Bitbucket.
All commits after 4PM will not be accepted.




Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block
