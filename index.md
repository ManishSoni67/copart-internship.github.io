## Welcome to Copart Internship 2017 summer coding camp

Copart Coding camp is an initiative to get students to think out side the box and bring in new design/development ideas. Copart believes that such events are good tools to attract new talent and also stimulate creative thinking. We encourage participation.
 

### RULES OF ENGAGEMENT
Each participant has to pick a problem statement below and show his/her work.
Do not copy. Try to be creative.
Understand what you are developing.
Code must be committed to Github or Bitbucket.
All commits after 4PM will not be accepted.
Code must have README.md
Code must have comments - We cannot read your mind.

## Coding Exercises - Problem statements

### Most Appropriate Facility  (Complex)
#### The Problem:
Given a request payload that contains a US zip code and a Customer ID, figure out the Closest Copart facility based on specific rules for a Customer. Think inclusion and exclusion rules.
1. Use a DB where appropriate.
2. Use any rules based engine where appropriate
3. Use any API as you see appropriate
4. Copart will provide a list of sample facilities

### JS Library/framework* based - Nested ListView (Simple)
#### The Problem:
JS based ListView - Must have multiple Nested list views - (eg) Countries, States, Cities. 
1. Single JSON response vs Multiple JSON response - Showcase both.
2. Reuse components and reuse data from cache/store
[*] - Use React or AngularJS or ember or backbone or one of the modern JS frameworks/libraries. Do not use JQuery or ExtJS

### Upcoming Auction Vehicle Search - UI/Web Service (Medium)
#### The Problem:
Given a listing of upcoming auctions, help the user narrow down to the vehicles that are of interest.
User should be able to search on Year, Make and Model in a region. Region is a grouping of one or more yards the user can choose from (Yards available in calendar service)\
Optional filters user can choose are damage description and title type to narrow the list further
The user interface should display the Year, Make, Model, Auction Date, Auction Yard, Address, Damage Description, and Vehicle images
The listing service documentation can be found at:
https://inventory.copart.io/docs/InventoryAPISpecification.html
Alternately, in the place of a user interface, you may also build a web service that will retrieve this information mentioned above.
